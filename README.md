## üìã Data Format

### JSON File Structure
Each JSON file contains an array of chunks, where each chunk represents a section of the 10-K document with extracted knowledge graph triplets.

**Keys in each dictionary entry:**
- `page_id`: Page identifier (e.g., "page_1")
- `chunk_id`: Chunk identifier within the page (e.g., "chunk_1") 
- `source_file`: Original PDF filename (e.g., "AAPL_10k_2024.pdf")
- `ticker`: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
- `chunk_triplet`: Dictionary containing extracted triplets
- `chunk_text`: Original text from the 10-K filing

### Triplet Structure
Each triplet is a 5-element array: `[Subject, Subject_Type, Relation, Object, Object_Type]`

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "page_id": "page_1",
    "chunk_id": "chunk_1", 
    "source_file": "AAPL_10k_2024.pdf",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "chunk_triplet": {
      "Triplet 1": [
        "Apple Inc.",           // Subject
        "ORG",                  // Subject Type
        "Has_Stake_In",         // Relation
        "Common Stock",         // Object
        "FIN_INST"             // Object Type
      ],
      "Triplet 2": [
        "Apple Inc.",
        "ORG", 
        "Has_Stake_In",
        "0.000% Notes due 2025",
        "FIN_INST"
      ]
    },
    "chunk_text": "## UNITED STATES\n\n## SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549\n\n## FORM 10-K..."
  }
]
```

### HTML Visualization Files

## üî¨ Extraction Methodologies

### 1. Single-Pass Extraction (`single_pass`)
**Comprehensive one-shot extraction with integrated normalization**

**Process Within Single Prompt**:
- **Step 1**: Maximum Triplet Extraction - Extract as many triplets as possible
- **Step 2**: Intelligent Normalization & Merging - Consolidate entities, standardize names, resolve company references
- **Step 3**: Strict JSON Formatting - Output structured triplets

**Key Features**:
- Entity name standardization (3-5 words max)
- Company reference normalization (consolidate variations to ticker symbols)  
- Duplicate entity merging and relationship consolidation
- Single comprehensive LLM call

### 2. Multi-Pass Extraction (`multi_pass`)
**Two-stage process with dedicated extraction and refinement phases**

**Stage 1 - Initial Extraction**:
- Maximum triplet extraction with basic normalization
- Company reference replacement with ticker symbols
- Initial entity name standardization

**Stage 2 - Dedicated Normalization**:
- Validate entity types and relationships against defined categories
- Advanced entity merging and relationship consolidation
- Remove redundant or duplicate triplets
- Ensure consistency in naming conventions

### 3. Reflection Extraction (`reflection`)
**Three-step iterative process with systematic self-correction**

**Step 1 - Initial Extraction**:
- Extract triplets following strict normalization rules
- All company references must use exact ticker symbol
- Concise entity naming (1-3 words, max 3 words)

**Step 2 - Critical Feedback**:
- Rigorous evaluation of extracted triplets
- Detailed feedback for each problematic triplet
- Issue identification with specific suggestions
- Assessment of entity quality, relationship validity, and business relevance

**Step 3 - Systematic Correction**:
- Correction of identified issues based on feedback
- Automatic dropping of low-value or incorrect triplets  
- Individual triplet correction using targeted prompts
